# Introduction

*Introduction and Research Questions*

Our goal is to gain a better look at how depression rates vary across the world by age group. This is important because mental health is a critical global issue, and understanding the variations in depression rates can aid in case-by-case treatments and mental health policies. To address this question, we will analyze a comprehensive dataset that records depression rates by country and age group, aiming to uncover patterns and trends that contribute to a better understanding of the mental health landscape worldwide.

Our research questions, based on our dataset, include:

• How do depression rates vary across different age groups in different countries?

• Are there significant differences in depression prevalence between developed and developing countries within specific age brackets?

• What is the overall trend of depression rates across different age groups globally? Are certain age groups more vulnerable to depression?

• How do depression rates within the U.S. compare to that of other countries looking at the same age groups?

• How do depression rates vary among age groups within the U.S.?

Understanding the variations in mental health disorders across age groups holds significant implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. Technologists can develop age-appropriate digital platforms and tools to support mental health, utilizing data analytics and Al for early detection and personalized interventions. Designers can create empathetic and user-centric interfaces, considering cultural sensitivities and regional differences to enhance accessibility and reduce stigma. Policymakers can use the insights to design evidence-based mental health policies that allocate resources effectively, catering to the specific needs of adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Strengthening mental health services in schools, workplaces, and geriatric care centers, and integrating mental health support into primary healthcare, can lead to improved mental health services, reduced stigma, and enhanced well-being across diverse populations.

*The Dataset*

Our dataset is from Mental Health Depression Disorder Data.

The data was collected by Saloni Dattani, Lucas Rodés-Guirao, Hannah Ritchie, and Max Roser from Our World in Data, a website dedicated to research on global issues.

This data was collected to reduce the burden of mental illness worldwide by providing reliable data to get more attention and support to the issue and those suffering with the illnesses. It was collected and generated using statistical methods on top of surveys and screening data from mental health patients worldwide.

When engaging with this data, it's crucial to recognize its potential impact in assisting individuals with mental health challenges. Ethical considerations regarding data collection methods should also be examined, ensuring the respect and well-being of participants.

The data does come with potential issues. One notable challenge is the reluctance of individuals to openly address their mental health concerns, particularly in regions where mental health awareness is limited. This can lead to skewed data representation, especially in areas where acknowledging such issues is culturally restricted. Another issue is the subjective nature of surveys and data collection, as interpretations of mental health issues can vary widely among individuals and across cultures. Additionally, there is data missing for age groups between 35 and 49. The exclusion of this group results in lack of proper representation and insight on depression rates of these age groups.

Our objective is to comprehensively examine global depression rates by age group, serving a crucial role in addressing the global mental health crisis. Through meticulous analysis of a comprehensive dataset, we aim to reveal underlying patterns and trends. This endeavor holds the potential to significantly inform tailored interventions, treatment strategies, and mental health policies that can positively impact diverse populations.

*Limitations and Challenges*

Throughout this project there will be many contributions and challenges that will increase the difficulty of having a correct analysis. Ensuring the data quality is accurate may be a challenge and there may be limitations in certain age groups which can lead to inaccurate data representation. Along with the difficulty of collecting information on mental health issues with different countries and regions. Due to the difference and stigma towards mental health, the dataset may not account for the different variations of mental health issues therefore leading to inaccurate conclusions.

Another limitation and challenge throughout this project may be the confounding variables. Identifying a correlating between age and mental health is not simple and there are many confounding variables within this study including economic status, cultural differences, along with more lifestyle factors. Due to these confounding variables, there are many limitations to accurately analyzing the dataset. Generalization must be avoided to ensure that the results are not too simplified towards a certain demographic and population.



# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

*Main Takeaways*

Each visualization we have led to its own key takeaways regarding depression rates by age group and/or location.

_Depression Rates of Age Groups by Country_

For this visualization, we look at individual countries and how depression rates vary for each age group over the years. A pattern we noticed is that for a lot of the countries, 70 year olds have the highest or higher rates of depression. This could be explained by various factors, such as smaller populations of older age groups, or older individuals feeling more lonely or isolated due to age. This pattern is especially seen among smaller, less developed countries, as opposed to developed and larger countries with more sophisticated economics and advanced infrastructure and technology. For these larger, more developed countries, a pattern observed is that the higher age groups mainly consist of younger age groups, such as 20-24 year olds, occasionally with the older age groups as well. For example, in the images above, the United Kingdom, a big developed country, has seen the most rates among 25 to 29 year olds. Malaysia, on the other hand, has seen the greatest rates among 70 year olds. The difference between these patterns could be explain by aging populations, differing societal and cultural norms, technological growth (or lack thereof), economic disparities, etc.

_Comparing the U.S. to Other Countries_

_U.S. Depression Rates Among Age Group By Year_

By looking at how depression rates have changed throughout the years in the U.S., we can see how specific factors that we are surrounded by in our daily lives can contribute to mental health. As seen in the two images above of 1990 and 2017 in the U.S., while 70 year olds consistenly have lower depression rates, over the years, the rates slowly drop down to below 4%, as opposed to being over 4% in the 1990s. This could be explained by improved healthcare, stronger social support, generational differences, etc. Inversely, rates for 10-14 year olds, also have lower rates, have increased over the years, jumping from below 2% in the 90s to over 2.5% recently. Additionally, from 1990 to 1999, the graph shows how the three age groups with the highest depression rates are 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34 year olds. After 1999, the depression rates for 15 to 19 year olds starts to increase, eventually becoming the age group with the second highest rate. The increase for younger age groups could be explained by cultural shifts or the rise of technology and social media.

*Important Insight*

Since the dataset does not explicitly measure other factors along with depression rates, it forces us to take a deeper look at potential explanations and factors that contribute to changing and varying depression rates among age groups and locations. Possible contributing explanations can include the impact of aging populations, shifting cultural and societal norms, the role of technological growth and the internet, economic and income disparities, access to mental health resources, average education levels, environmental factors, and more. By looking at data on specific countries and age groups, we can simultaneously take into account other information about the location and age group to help gain more context on the depression rates. If we look at the data as a whole, conclusions and implications may be too general or unmeaningful.

*Implications*

The broader and main implications are to gain a deeper understanding of depression rates and mental health issues according to different contexts. Specialized and specific policies for different age groups, within different countries, and even for different contributing factors are needed to properly address mental health issues and help those who are struggling. As seen in our visualizations, not only is there variation among countries of different qualities and factors, there is also significant change and variation among age groups in the U.S. due to age and other variables. This means the policies, measures, and treatments require holistic approaches.
